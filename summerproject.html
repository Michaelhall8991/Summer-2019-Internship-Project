		<h3>Hello; my name is Michael Hall and I am very interested in acquiring a summer internship at your organization. And while a resume is perfectly ok; I believe going above and beyond to impress perspective employers. By creating this project for your organiztion I hope to give myself a better chance at earning the chance to participate in your summer internship program. In this project that I created I have put multiple pages which gives you more in depth information about me, my educational background and the skills that I have acquired, some of my interests which relate to my future career goals and other hobbies as well. I have also created sections that give you my contact information as well as a simple javascript project to display some of my knowledge in this field of study which I am currently interested in. So please click around and explore and see what I have to offer and what else you can learn about me. I will also be leaving some of my contact information below and I will also be attaching two javascript projects that I created to further display my knowledge. And I hope that I will be hearing from you soon.</h3>
