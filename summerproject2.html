			<h3>My name is Michael Hall I am a 20 year old college student, and I live in Prince George's County Maryland. I have a strong interest in anything that deals with technology, whether it be coding, cloud computing, or machine learning. Although I am primarily focused on learning how to code. If it involves technology then I'm interested with it. I have been facinated and intigued with technology ever since I was a child but for a while I thought that I would never be smart enough to ever be able to do anything in the tech industry. But that all changed when I was in collge. My teacher had given the entire class a project to pick out three careers that you would be interested in. And while I was at first stumped on what careers that I should pick out; my classmate told me about web developing and coding. I decided to look up what coding was and I was instantly intrigued by coding and all the possibilities and the capabilities that coding had. And thats where my fascination with technology turned into a passion. From then on I had tried to learn how to code and learn all that Icould about web developing; it wasn't easy and I was very confused at first and it was very difficult. but I really wanted to learn how to code so that I could build my own website. So I searched through the internet and there were so many people and so many websites that promised me that I could learn how to code in ten minutes. I was skeptical of these promises that seemed to make coding look as easy as riding a bike. So instead of falling for these baseless and vague promises. So I had went to youtube and I looked up vidoes that promised teaching me how to code. And again there were many videos promising to teach me everything I needed to know about coding in ten minutes. But i had been able to find some reputable videos on youtube that taught me different beginner coding techniques and I aslo recived good advice on how I should move forward and continue to grow my knowledge in learning everything I can about the tech industry and how I can succeed in such a fast paced industry. Through sheer perserverance and paying attention to detail I have been able to learn how use HTML5, CSS, Jvascript, and PHP. I also have created four different rules for me to abide by when I am learning how to code or when I am currently doing a coding project; these rules have helped me through the many challenges that come along with coding.<br><br> Rule number 1: Always perservere. This rule may not sound special but it matters a lot, when you are coding you will definitely run into challenges and you will make mistakes that will inhibit your progress. I've learned that by taking a step back and taking a five minute break or going over your work again in a more detailed manner will solve almost any problem you encounter when you are coding. Rule number 2: always be willing and ready to learn. the tech industry is far different than any other industry it's extremely fast paced and there's a;ways something new. And coding is unique among the tech industry as well, there are tons of promgramming languages and techniques and text editors that make up coding and what you know today may not be entirely relvant in five years. It's not to say you're always going to have to start from scratch everytime something new comes out but there's always goign to be a new technique or a new version of a programming language thats available and if you're resistant to learning new things you'll definitely fall behind and that adss to the difficulty of coding which is already challenging. Although you should be careful when learning new things. Something new that comes out could just be a fad that quickly falls out of relavance. And wasting your time trying to learn everything is improbable as well as almost impossible in my opinion. Rule number 3: dont be afriad to ask for help. This is a big one for me and it's a very simple rule but it's something people are afriad to do. Asking for help doesn't make you any lesser than anyone else and in fact it shows that you are willing to learn and become a better coder. and last but not least rule number 4: be patient. Patience is a virtue in all facets of life; and especially true in coding. You won't become a top tier coder in two weeks or even in two months. you have to be patient and stop trying learn everything as quickly as possible. In my experience learning anything important in the tech field takes daily practice and a lot of research and dedication. Just move at a comfortabe pace and don't be lazy. In my conclusion I'd like to state that I am very interested in interning with your organization and I hope that I will hear from you soon, thank you.</h3>
