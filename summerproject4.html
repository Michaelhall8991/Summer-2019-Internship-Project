			<h3>Interest #1: Coding<br><br> Coding is my primary interest as of right now. I am genuinely intrigued and fascinated by coding; there is a myraid of possibilities that can be explored with coding.there are so many programming languages and there are countless text editors and there is so much knowledge that is available to be explored and experimented with when it comes to coding. In my opinion I think that coding is one of the most valuable skills a person could learn; espeacially if they are interested in a future career in the tech industry.</h3>

If we are all educated then we can all work togtehr to uplift society as a whole.</h3>
